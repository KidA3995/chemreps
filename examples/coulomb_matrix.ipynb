We are going to first create an empty list called rep_list in which we will store information such as the filename and the representation. Next we loop over all of the files in the directory using glob to match our pattern (eg. we want all sdf files from our data/sdf/ directory). In this loop we use the same method as above in order to make our representations. We store the name of the file and the representation in a dictionary that is then appended to our rep_list. Once the loop is complete, we store the information in a pandas dataframe."
