# Representation Tutorials

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chemreps/chemreps/master?filepath=examples%2F)

This directory contains interactive Jupyter notebooks to help show how chemreps can be used to make various representations of molecules for machine learning.
To run the example notebooks in a web-hosted environment, click the binder badge above. 
This will launch a hosted instance of the notebooks, without requiring and installation on your part.

Representation tutorials:
1. Bag of Bonds
    - BagMaker: How to make bags for your dataset
    - Bag of Bonds: How to make a representation for a molecule file
    - Handling multiple molecules: Example of how to make representations for an entire dataset

2. Just Bonds
    - Same as the bag of bonds notebook except it is performed using the just bonds representation.

Disclaimer: In order to run these interactive notebooks locally Jupyter needs to be installed.
